  		Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are         flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
